title: Technical Debt
---

Technical Debt is a metaphor coined by a Software programmer - **Ward Cunningham**.
What he meant by the term debt was that - when we borrow money from someone we are granted with that sudden purchasing power, but until you pay back the entire amount you are going to continue to pay the interest for something which is not completely owned by you.

  

Similarly, rushing software out the door seems like a good idea, but eventually, you would have to go back and repay that loan by refactoring the program to reflect your knowledge of the program as you acquire it.

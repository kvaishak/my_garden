title: Binary (black-and-white) thinking, overgeneralization
---

Good-evil, smart-stupid, beautiful-ugly, tall-short, fast-slow, and so on and on. We think in binary terms. Our language reflects that. And some people are stuck very hard in such thinking. The worst case of it is _all-or-nothing_ thinking, when any result other than the best is considered as a failure. It causes stress and depression in people. They don’t realize anymore why the world is so mean to them. They stop seeing how many gradients are there, and also how colorful our world is.

A similar flaw is _overgeneralization_. We put into the same category very broad types of information. Prejudice, labeling, stereotypes are all related to overgeneralization.

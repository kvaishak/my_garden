title: What separates us from Originals

 From [The surprising habits of original thinkers by Adam Grant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U)

## They are late to the party
Procrastinators are found to have a much more creative process than those who procrastinates or those who wait till the end of the deadline.

What happens is when told about a task, and then the person procrastinating (delaying acting on that task moderately) gives the mind some time to actively think about that task without acting on it.

Tasks are still active in our mind, when we procrastinate and goes on in our life with other activities. This helps in formulating a better way to do that task.

> You call it procrastinating, I call it thinking

Hence procrastinating helps nurture creativity.

##  They feel doubts and Fear
The originals undergoes the same doubts and fears just like the rest of us. What separates us from them are that, 
They are afraid of failing, but even more they are afraid of failing to try.

> In the long run our biggest regret are not our actions, but our inaction.

Most of our creative process follows the following steps.
1. This is awesome
2. This is tricky
3. This is crap
4. *I am crap*
5. This might be okay
6. This is awesome

What one must take care is to try to avoid undergoing the **Step 4**. One must embrace the fact that the first draft of anything will be shitty and one must try to improve upon it.


## Originals have lots of bad ideas
Greatest originals are one who fail the most, because they are the ones who try the most.

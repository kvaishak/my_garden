From [5 hindrances to self-mastery by Shi Heng YI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-079YIasck)

## Sensual Desire
Don't follow the temptations that might try to seduce you on your way to your goal. Once you fall to these temptations, you will become obsessed by those temptations and then your actual goal would have become nothing but a un-achievable dream.

## Ill will
State of mind which comes from negative emotions.
There might be situations that you don't like, persons whom you might despise etc, along your path, which you might have to encounter on your way to your goal. 
Don't be discouraged by those. Let go of the hatred or the ill will and continue on your journey.

## Dullness/heaviness
Characterised by sleepiness, lack of motivation, lack of energy, leading to depression.
Described in Buddhism as Imprisonment, one must have to find a way to come out of it in order to continue towards your goal. Nobody is free from experiencing all these. But what you have to do is realize this and try to find a way to come out of it.

## Restlessness
A state of unsettled mind. This normally happens when
* worrying about future
* traveling to past and rejecting or judging a past event


## Skeptical Doubt
This is due to the indecisiveness of your brain. The constant doubt in your brain asking yourself the questions like	'What if this ?' or 'What if that'. These questions will make you disconnect with your goals and aspirations that you have set for yourself.

When faced with too much doubts more often you will stop, rather than moving forward.

###  What to do ?
Let it RAIN 

**R** - Recognise what state of mind you are currently in.

**A** - Accept the situation that you are in. Let it be in that state.

**I** - Investigate and ask questions about your current stage . Why you are in that stage ?

**N** - Non-Identify know that you are not your body, mind or your emotions and act on what to be done to make yourself come out of that stage.



There are two mistakes along the way to self Mastery :
> Not starting It and Not going all the way.

title: The Little Moments
---

As we get older, we start to realize that it's not so much  about the material stuff. Its about the fact that so much time has gone by, and all of it faster than you ever wanted it to.

In the end, all we have are the **little moments** that we have lived with the people we love.

But most of our time we find ourselves caught up in the routine monotonous life and suddenly gasp at the realization of how quickly days, months or even years have passed by without our knowledge. Our mind tends to zone out and run on auto pilot. Its that easy to get caught up in routine. Our mind tends to take the least effortless path in living our daily life and a routine means less variation in our day to day activities and hence less effort.

Overtime a routine lifestyle can either makes us bored or blind to the passage of time.

According to Viktor E Frankl (the author of [[Man's Search for meaning]]) boredom is one of the main contributors to [[Existential Frustration]].

So when you feel that you are being engulfed by **The Routine**, try to change things up. New experienced snap you out of that routine and have you aware of your surroundings. This results in a metaphorical slowing down of time so that our brain can process all this new information.

Ever wondered why our childhood felt so long ? This is because of the extreme absence of routine in our childhood, where we tend to learn or experience things for the first time almost every other day.

Plan different vacations, try to do something new on the weekends, go to a different coffee shop before work.

 > **The idea is to just try to break routine when possible.**

title: Existential Frustration
---

Coined by Author Viktor E Frankl in his book [[Man's Search for meaning]]

It is the frustration that arises when an individual is striving to find a concrete meaning in personal existence.

Existential frustration, unlike how the name implies is not portrayed in a negative manner by the author. Instead he says that **suffering** is not always a pathological phenomenon: rather suffering may well be a human achievement, especially if the suffering grows out of existential frustration.

> A man's concern, even his despair over the worthwhileness of life is an existential distress, but by no means a mental disease.

In-fact it is this frustration that helps us search for and realise the meaning of one's life. There is nothing in the world, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in ones life.

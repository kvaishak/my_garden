title: Shortcomings of HTML Rendering
---

I was accepted for the position of Member technical staff for the team <a href="https://show.zoho.com/">Zoho Show</a> at Zoho corporation in June of 2017. Zoho Show is the Zoho’s answer to Google Slides in a feature-rich package. My first task as a Web Developer in Zoho show was to code a feature that allows the shapes drawn inside Show to have Inner/Outer Borders. Up until then, Zoho show had the option to just choose between different types of the border like dotted, dashed etc and to change their width, but not the alignment of the border concerning the shape.

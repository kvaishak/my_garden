title: Aggregation of Marginal Gains
---

from [[Atomic Habits]]

“The aggregation of marginal gains,” which is the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.

The whole principle came down from the idea that if you could break down everything you could think of that goes into doing a particular task and then improve it by 1 percent constantly, you will get significantly better at doing that task, when you put them all together.

At 2003, when Dave Brailsford, was hired as the new performance director for the British cycling team, at that time professional cyclists in Great Britain had endured nearly one hundred years of       
mediocrity. Since 1908, British riders had won just single gold medal at the Olympic Games, and they had fared even worse in cyclings biggest race, the Tour de France. In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event.

After the arrival of Brailsford, he implemented the philosophy of “Aggregation of Marginal Gains”, by making small adjustments you might expect from a professional cycling team. He did that on a continuous basis, and as a result all these hundreds of small improvements accumulated and the results came faster than anyone could have imagined.

Just 5 years after Brailsford took over, the British Cycling team dominated the road and track cycling events at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, where they won an astounding 60 percent of the gold medals available. Four years later, when the Olympic Games came to London, the Brits set a score of nine Olympic records and seven world records.

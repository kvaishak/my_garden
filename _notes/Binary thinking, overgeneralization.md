title: Binary (black-and-white) thinking, overgeneralization
---

Good-evil, smart-stupid, beautiful-ugly, tall-short, fast-slow, and so on and on. We think in binary terms. Our language reflects that. And some people are stuck very hard in such thinking. The worst case of it is *all-or-nothing* thinking, when any result other than the best is considered as a failure. It causes stress and depression in people. They donâ€™t realise anymore why the world is so mean to them. They stop seeing how many gradients are there, and also how colourful our world is.

A similar flaw is *overgeneralisation*. We put into the same category very broad types of information. Prejudice, labelling, stereotypes are all related to overgeneralisation.
